            <p>Nice of you to visit! My name is Keegan, I currently have my Associate's Degree in Library Science,
                 am finishing up my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, and am also planning on getting my Master's Degree in Library Science.
                I'm an avid reader, and also greatly enjoy working with my hands (coding Python and C are not included in that).</p>
            <p>Skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Formally Educated in HTML, Python, and C</li>
                <li>Minor Experience with CSS</li>
                <li>One Hyper Specific Cocktail Involving Greek Yogurt and Sumac</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Fun Factoids:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I have a large collection of miniatures I have assembled and hand painted, including one that I heavily modified with sculpting and specially ordered 3rd Party 3d printed parts.</li>
                <li>Avid Reader. Current Book Waitlist: Eight</li>
                <li>I like to chase Platinum Trophies on Playstation. My current goal is getting every achievement in every Souls game. I currently have two out of seven, almost finished with a third.</li>
